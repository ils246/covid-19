Public data and code for reproducibility regarding aggregate findings from the paper: "Controlling COVID-19: labor structure is more important than policy." 
Individual-level data is excluded here on account of privacy/ethical concerns. Therefore, these findings can only be used to approximately reproduce estimates from Tables 2b, 2d, and 7-8. 

What's here?
-mobility metrics (1).csv contains municipality level estimates for mean/percentile behavior changes from the basal period to the study period.
-muni_level_info.csv contains some economic/demographic information (which we use in our analyses) for the studied cities -including labor formality, GDP per capita, economic complexity, and population. In addition, this table has the fraction of days users were allowed out (on average) during the study period.
-Aggregate results and figures.ipynb uses this data to construct aggregate findings as noted above.
Because of the bootstrapping scheme used to generate these tables (which relies on individual-level data to resample aggregate metrics), standard errors reported here (using OLS with municipality-level point estimates) are slightly different from those in the text. 
-pico y ced√∫la.zip displays advertisements of local resutriction for all municipalities covered in the study during the period of interest. In addition, tpw.xlsx.
