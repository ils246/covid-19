Data and code for reproducibility regarding aggregate findings from the paper: "Controlling COVID-19: labor structure is more important than policy." 
Individual-level data is excluded here on account of privacy/ethical concerns. Therefore, these findings can only be used to approximately reproduce coefficient estimates from Tables 2b, 2d, 3a/3b, and S1. 

What's here?
-mobility metrics.csv contains municipality level estimates for mean/percentile behavior changes from the basal period to the study period.
-muni_level_info.csv contains some economic/demographic information (which we use in our analyses) for the studied cities -including labor formality, GDP per capita, economic complexity, and population. In addition, this table has the fraction of days users were allowed out (on average) during the study period.
-Aggregate results and figures.ipynb uses this data to construct aggregate findings as noted above.
Because of the bootstrapping scheme used to generate these tables (which relies on individual-level data to resample aggregate metrics), standard errors reported here (using OLS with municipality-level point estimates) are slightly different from those in the text. 
-pico y ced√∫la.zip has all the local advertisements in image files. 
-tpw.xlsx uses the information from the local advertisement in the form of population share allowed out daily, given expectations (muncipalities have equal gender representation and ID numbers are distributed uniformly, so that each resident's number is equally like to end in 1 or 9). 
The last row in tpw.xlsx takes an average over the study period days for each municipality.
