Public data and code for reproducibility regarding aggregate findings from the paper: "Controlling COVID-19: labor structure is more important than policy." 
Individual-level data is excluded here on account of privacy/ethical concerns. Therefore, these findings can only be used to approximately reproduce estimates from Tables 2b, 2d, and 7-8. Because of the bootstrapping scheme used to generate these tables (which relies on individual-level data to resample aggregate metrics), standard errors reported here (using OLS with municipality-level point estimates) are slightly different from those in the text.
